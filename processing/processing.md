## Slide 0 - What Is Processing?

Processing is an open-source programming environment designed to make coding accessible for artists, designers, students, and educators. Launched in 2001, it’s  a language, a minimal development environment, and a community that helps people learn how to code through visual and interactive projects. Today, it’s used in classrooms to art studios—for creative exploration, prototyping, and teaching programming fundamentals.Processing was originally created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry at MIT Media Lab. It is maintained by the Processing Foundation and the Processing community.

Since early 2024, with support from the Processing Foundation, our two-person team resumed active development on Processing. Our main challenge was to reconstruct knowledge of the codebase without a formal handover from the previous maintainer.
